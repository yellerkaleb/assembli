# 🧠 Image Tagging System (Assembli Take-Home)

A lightweight full-stack image tagging tool that allows users to upload images, run server-side tagging and embedding generation, and view results in a web UI with previews.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React (in root directory)
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI (in `backend/` folder)
- **ML Model:** ResNet18 (ImageNet, via PyTorch)
- **Database:** SQLite for metadata and embedding storage

---

## 🖥️ Frontend (React)

### Features:

- Multi-image file uploader
- Auto-upload + processing pipeline
- Real-time UI feedback
- Image preview with tag and error info

### Setup:

```bash
# From project root
npm install
npm start
```

Runs on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## 🚀 Backend (FastAPI + PyTorch)

### Features:

- `POST /upload`: Save image to `uploads/` folder
- `GET /process-folder`: Process all saved images
  - Tags with ResNet18
  - Generates embeddings (512D)
  - Stores results in `image_metadata.db`
- `GET /uploads/<filename>`: Serves uploaded images for preview in UI

### Setup:

```bash
# From project root
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Runs on: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Run the backend:  
   `cd backend && python main.py`

2. Run the frontend:  
   `npm start`

3. Open the app:  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

4. Upload images → wait for processing → view results in table with previews.
